## Thomas Bierly's ePortfolio

Please find the following details as an indicative example of an IIT student's profile.

### Intro

Thomas Bierly is an American citizen who now resides in Australia. He is an avid gamer and a total nerd. When not grading papers, you can often find him drowning in his research. In the off chance he's taken a break from uni life, he's likely drinking coffee or exploring the virtual world of Eorzia. 

### Personality

![image](https://i.imgur.com/rWu0kFq.jpeg) Just like Gandalf the Grey, Thomas is an INTJ-T on the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. This means Thomas has a very curious personality, always up for learning something new. He is very creative about the ways he might solve problems and is strategic to a fault (often overlooking short term wins for long term strengths). He is stubbornly independent and a decisive decisionmaker. He eschews authority figures and social convensions, ignoring who or what may be popular, in order to evaluate the ideas by their own merits. While these strengths enable Thomas to achive great outcomes, he can potentially rub people the wrong way. While he has no-doubt spent countless hours analyticallys evaluating problems from over angle, his confidence in his solutions can be mischaracterised as arrogance by those not familiar with his work ethic. INTJ-Ts also loath highly structured environments and may feel micro-managed or opressed if the team structure is too rigid. Thomas would work best in an open minded team, however, he may need someone to tie him down to the imediate practicalities of impending due dates, else he might devise a twenty year plan to take over the world. He is also a Ravenclaw in Hogwarts.

### Job

### Project

Thomas's project idea is to create a Machine Learning Algorith that will display a screensaver with moving shapes and colourful elements that match the music playing on the speakers. The goal is to create a breathtaking synesthetic artistic expression using artificial intelligence. This will demonstrate AI's ability to engage in creative works, as well as analytial ones.
